    <string name="bio"> Hi, my name is Ulises.
    \n\n I love fish.
    \n\n The kind that is alive and swims around in an aquarium or a river, or a lake, and definitely the Ocean.
    \nFun fact is that I have several aquariums and also a river.
    \nI like eating fish, too. Raw fish. Grilled fish. Smoked fish. Poached fish- not so much.
    \nAnd sometimes I even go fishing.
    \n\nOnce, when I was camping in Canada, and very hungry, I even caught a large salmon with my hands.
    \n\nI\'ll be happy to teach you how to make your own aquarium.
    \nYou should ask someone else about fishing, though.\n\n</string>
